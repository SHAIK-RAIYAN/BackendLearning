# 🎉 Welcome to NodeBackendDaily! 🎉

This repository is my personal log of learning backend development with **Node.js**. Every day, I’ll be adding new code, notes, and reflections on what I’ve learned. Whether you’re a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore and follow along!

## 🚀 Purpose

I’m creating this repository to:

- Track my progress in learning Node.js for backend development  
- Share my journey with others who might be on a similar path  
- Build a portfolio of projects and code samples  
- Stay motivated by committing to daily updates  

---

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:

- A Markdown file with notes and explanations  
- Code files for any projects or exercises completed that day  
- Possibly, screenshots or diagrams to illustrate concepts  

Each folder is named with the date (starting from `2025-06-22`) to keep things chronological.
