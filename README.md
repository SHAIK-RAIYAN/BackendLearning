🎉 Welcome to NodeBackendDaily! 🎉
This repository is my personal log of learning backend development with Node.js. Every day, I’ll be adding new code, notes, and reflections on what I’ve learned. Whether you’re a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore and follow along!
🚀 Purpose
I’m creating this repository to:  

Track my progress in learning Node.js for backend development.  
Share my journey with others who might be on a similar path.  
Build a portfolio of projects and code samples.  
Stay motivated by committing to daily updates.

📁 Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:  

A markdown file with notes and explanations.  
Code files for any projects or exercises completed that day.  
Possibly, screenshots or diagrams to illustrate concepts.

Each folder is named with the date, starting from 2025-06-22, to keep things chronological.
🛠️ How to Use

Browse the daily folders to see my progress.
