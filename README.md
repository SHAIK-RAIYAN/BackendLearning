# 🎉 NodeBackendDaily — Node.js & Database Learning Archive 🎉

Welcome to **NodeBackendDaily** — a personal archive of all my code written while learning **Node.js** and **databases**. This repository is not a collection of full-fledged projects, but rather a set of **simple, focused code snippets** that demonstrate backend fundamentals.

## ✅ Status

> **Learning Completed**  
> This repository now serves as a **reference archive** for backend concepts using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL.
